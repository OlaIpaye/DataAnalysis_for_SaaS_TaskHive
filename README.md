# DataAnalysis_for_SaaS_TaskHive

TaskHive is a fictional company that offers subscription to their online platform for project management.

## Project Sumnmary

The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to understand and analyse a dataset using the exploratory data analysis(EDA) process.

**Tools used in this project:**

- Microsoft Excel, for exploratory data analysis(EDA).
- SaaS company Datasets, from Datacamp platform.
- Git, for documenting my process and pushing work to Github.
- Git Bash command line interface, for cloning the remote repository on my local computer and for creating and accessing folders and images for this project.

## Summarising Data Using PivotTable (EDA)

- **Finding out how many subscriptions TaskHive has sold and for how much:**
  Using the TaskHive account sales worksheet, I created a pivot table to quickly summarise, familiarise and explore the dataset I am working with.

  This helped me quickly learn of some important figures such as: **TaskHive sold 35,101 subscriptions and for £693,025, with an average customer bringing in £312 each month.**
